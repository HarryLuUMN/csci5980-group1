# Vision Mamba

The Main Body part is the part in which we ran our experiments. 

Main Body: 
 - model.py: contains all three models
 - test.py: testing pipeline
 - train.py: training pipeline
 - metricstrackers.py: metrics file

Drafts and Demo
 - ViT.ipynb: exploratory ViT file for demo
 - vision-mamba-for-healthcare.ipymb: exploratory mamba file for demo

Vision Mamba required a Linux environment for training. 

the code didn't included the model checkpoint files due to the upload memory limitation of github.
